	  or "V.ADI.KON" for complex verbs.

    morphofeat: if the term is a named entity (type="entity"), the type of the entity (otpional).

    case: declension case of the term (otpional).

  which is a string composed by four fields separated by a dash. 
  The four fields are the following:


  - Language code (three characters).
  - WordNet version (two digits).
  - Synset identifier composed by digits.
  - POS character:
    n noun
    v verb
    a adjective
